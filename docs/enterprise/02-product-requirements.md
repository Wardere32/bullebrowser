# Volume 2: Product Requirements

## 1. Objective

Evolve BulleBrowser into a secure enterprise work platform while preserving the existing Electron desktop shell, React/TypeScript renderer, typed preload and IPC boundary, `WebContentsView` tab runtime, Chrome DevTools Protocol browser control, BYOK model access, and modular agent architecture in `packages/agent-core`.

## 2. Repository baseline

Codex must treat these existing components as the implementation baseline:

- `apps/desktop`: Electron desktop application
- `apps/web`: Next.js public website
- `packages/agent-core`: perceive, plan, act, verify, report runtime
- `packages/brand-tokens`: shared visual tokens
- `services/widget-backend`: backend service surface
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: process and browser architecture
- `docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`: current agent modules and safety defaults

Existing invariants that must not regress:

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- sandboxed renderer
- secrets outside renderer state
- typed IPC boundary
- local-first operation
- explicit confirmation for sensitive actions
- compatibility with existing skills and model selection

## 3. Product principles

1. User control before autonomy.
2. Local-first by default.
3. Explicit approval for consequential actions.
4. Provider-neutral AI architecture.
5. Evidence-linked and auditable execution.
6. Least privilege across users, processes, tools, connectors, and services.
7. Versioned extension contracts.
8. Enterprise capability must not degrade personal desktop use.

## 4. Scope

### In scope

- personal and organization workspaces
- identity, teams, RBAC, and policy
- provider-neutral model gateway
- governed agent execution
- MCP-compatible tools and resources
- connector framework and SDK
- session and persistent memory
- projects, comments, reviews, and approvals
- administration, licensing, analytics, and audit
- internal APIs, public APIs, events, and webhooks
- CI/CD, release, rollback, and observability

### Initial exclusions

- autonomous financial transactions
- silent regulated-form submissions
- credential harvesting or access-control bypass
- unrestricted remote browser control
- plaintext secret storage
- cloud synchronization without explicit policy and user notice

## 5. Personas

- **Independent consultant:** private grant, RFP, research, and compliance workflows.
- **Program manager:** projects, deadlines, artifacts, reviews, and evidence trails.
- **Compliance reviewer:** source-linked findings, version history, and approval gates.
- **Organization administrator:** users, roles, providers, connectors, retention, audit, and licensing.
- **Security administrator:** identity, secrets, logging, residency, and incident controls.
- **Developer:** tools, skills, connectors, MCP servers, SDKs, and fixtures.

## 9. Codex implementation rules

Codex must:

1. inspect existing files before creating or modifying modules;
2. reuse existing types and patterns where compatible;
3. avoid renaming public IPC channels without a migration plan;
4. avoid replacing the current agent loop with a parallel implementation;
5. add interfaces before provider-specific implementations;
6. keep enterprise features behind explicit configuration or feature flags until verified;
7. add unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for each new capability;
8. run repository validation before marking work complete;
9. document unresolved decisions rather than inventing hidden assumptions;
10. keep each pull request limited to one coherent implementation slice.

## 10. Required validation commands

Codex must run the applicable repository commands after each implementation slice:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Desktop behavior changes must also run the existing desktop end-to-end suite. Packaging or release changes must execute the applicable packaging workflow in a non-production test context.

## 11. Acceptance gates

Volume 2 is complete when:

- every requirement has a stable identifier;
- requirements do not contradict existing architecture invariants;
- enterprise capabilities are separable from personal local-first use;
- identity, policy, audit, and tenancy precede collaborative cloud features;
- consequential actions remain approval-gated;
- implementation rules and validation commands are explicit;
- downstream architecture and playbooks can trace implementation work to these requirement IDs.

## 12. Dependency order

1. shared domain contracts and feature flags
2. identity, organization, tenancy, and RBAC
3. policy, approval, and audit foundations
4. provider-neutral model gateway
5. MCP and connector contracts
6. memory and retrieval boundaries
7. projects, collaboration, and review
8. administration and licensing
9. public APIs and webhooks
10. production hardening and release gates

## 13. Open decisions

These decisions must be resolved through ADRs before implementation:

- local-only versus hosted enterprise control plane
- organization data residency model
- identity provider and session technology
- database and tenant-isolation strategy
- event transport and audit retention design
- licensing enforcement boundary
- supported model providers for the first enterprise release
