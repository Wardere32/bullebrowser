# Releasing BulleBrowser

End-to-end checklist for shipping a new version.

## 0. Prerequisites (one-time)

### GitHub repository secrets

Configure the following under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE` | `build-desktop.yml` | Base64 of the `.p12` **Developer ID Application** certificate |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | `build-desktop.yml` | Password for the `.p12` |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE` | `build-desktop.yml` | Base64 of the `.pfx` Authenticode signing certificate |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | `build-desktop.yml` | Password for the `.pfx` |

Plus **one** of the two macOS notarization credential sets:

| Apple-ID method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID used for notarization |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password generated at appleid.apple.com |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | 10-character Apple Developer Team ID |

| App Store Connect API-key method (preferred) | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_API_KEY` | Base64 of the `.p8` API key (decoded to a temp file in CI) |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` | Key ID of the App Store Connect API key |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER` | Issuer ID of the App Store Connect API key |

> **Important:** macOS public releases (tagged `v*.*.*`) must be Developer ID–signed
> and notarized so Gatekeeper accepts them without any "unidentified developer" /
> "is damaged" prompt. The workflow **hard-fails** a tagged release when the
> signing/notarization secrets are missing, and the afterSign hook
> (`apps/desktop/scripts/notarize.cjs`) hard-fails if the produced app isn't
> notarized + stapled + Gatekeeper-accepted — so an un-notarized DMG can never
> be published. Non-tag runs fall back to an ad-hoc-signed build for testing.

The landing page deploys to **GitHub Pages** — no third-party host and
no secrets required.

### Enable GitHub Pages (one-time)

1. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` (or run the `deploy-web` workflow manually). The
   `deploy-web.yml` workflow builds the static export and publishes it.

That alone makes the site live at the project URL:
`https://wardere83.github.io/bullebrowser/`.

### Custom domain `bullebrowser.com` (optional, free)

The repo ships `apps/web/public/CNAME` pinned to `bullebrowser.com`, so
the build is already configured for the apex domain. To activate it:

1. At your domain registrar, add the GitHub Pages **apex A records**:
   - `A  185.199.108.153`
   - `A  185.199.109.153`
   - `A  185.199.110.153`
   - `A  185.199.111.153`
   - (optionally the matching `AAAA` records for IPv6)
   - `www.bullebrowser.com` → `CNAME wardere83.github.io`
2. In **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**, enter `bullebrowser.com` and
   tick **Enforce HTTPS** once the certificate is issued.

To preview at the **project URL before DNS is ready**: delete
`apps/web/public/CNAME` and set a repository variable
`PAGES_BASE_PATH=/bullebrowser` (**Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions → Variables**). The workflow reads it and builds with that base
path so assets resolve under `/bullebrowser/`.

## 1. Bump the version

```
# in repo root
pnpm version --workspaces patch    # or minor / major
git add .
git commit -m "chore(release): bump to v$(node -p "require('./apps/desktop/package.json').version")"
git push origin main
```

## 2. Tag the release

```
TAG="v$(node -p "require('./apps/desktop/package.json').version")"
git tag "$TAG"
git push origin "$TAG"
```

The push to a `v*.*.*` tag triggers `build-desktop.yml`, which:

1. Runs typecheck + tests in parallel on macOS, Windows, and Linux runners.
2. Builds the Electron app on each platform with code signing. On macOS the
   app is **Developer ID–signed** with hardened runtime + entitlements
   (`resources/entitlements.mac.plist` / `entitlements.mac.inherit.plist`).
3. **Notarizes** the macOS app via `xcrun notarytool submit --wait`,
   **staples** the ticket (`xcrun stapler staple`), and **validates**
   Gatekeeper acceptance (`stapler validate` + `spctl --assess --type execute`)
   in the afterSign hook — then a separate workflow step re-verifies the
   produced `.app` bundles. Any failure on a tagged release aborts the run.
4. Computes SHA-256 checksums.
5. Publishes a GitHub Release with all installers and `checksums.txt`
   attached, plus auto-generated notes from Conventional Commits since
   the previous tag.

### Publish now (no local tag tooling)

If you need downloads live immediately and do not want to create/push a
tag locally, run `build-desktop` manually:

1. Go to **Actions → build-desktop → Run workflow**.
2. Set `version` to a semver like `0.2.0`.
3. Leave `publish_release` as `true`.

The workflow stamps package versions for the build, produces signed
installers per platform, and publishes a GitHub Release at
`v<version>` from the selected commit.

### If macOS shows "could not verify free of malware"

That means the downloaded app is not notarized by Apple (usually from an
internal/manual build). For temporary local testing only, you can run:

```
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/BulleBrowser.app
```

For public distribution, do not use this workaround. Re-run release with
all notarization secrets configured so Gatekeeper verifies the build.

## CI safeguards (added after v0.2.0 incident)

To prevent CI regressions that can invalidate entire release runs:

1. The `ci.yml` quality job rejects any step-level workflow condition that
   references `secrets.*` directly in `if:`.
2. `build-desktop.yml` probes macOS secret availability into step outputs
   and gates signing/notarization steps on those outputs.
3. Desktop smoke launch helper is idempotent to AI panel default state
   (open or closed), so default-setting changes do not break e2e startup.

## 3. Verify the release

- Download each installer from the release page and run it on a clean VM.
- Confirm the in-app About page shows the new version and a populated
  third-party-notices table.
- Confirm `electron-updater` picks up the release (older builds will
  prompt to update on next launch).

## 4. Deploy the web changes

The `deploy-web.yml` workflow runs automatically on any push to `main`
that touches `apps/web/**` or shared packages, building the static
export and publishing it to GitHub Pages. The download page and the
home-page download button fetch the latest release directly from the
GitHub API in the visitor's browser, so a freshly published release
shows up on the site as soon as the GitHub API reflects it (no rebuild
of the site required).

## 5. Rollback

If a release is broken:

1. Mark the GitHub Release as **draft** so users on stale clients don't
   auto-update.
2. Tag the previous good version as `latest` by editing the older release.
3. Investigate, ship a fix, and follow steps 1-4 again.
